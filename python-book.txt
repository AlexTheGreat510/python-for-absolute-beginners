Python For Absolute Beginners
Created By Shivansh Shrivastava.
Introduction

    • Python is the scripting language created in C.
    • Its easy to use compared to other programming languages like Java, C, C++ and Golang.
    • It has a rather extensive standard library which includes packages like urllib (library to make requests on web), argparse (my favourite, is used to parse command line arguments).
    • It has a lot, I mean a lot of creative external packages like (colorama, requesets, pyside2, numpy, matplotlib, astropy, etc.) just a names of few!
Writing our first program in python

    1. Install text editor for your platform (like notepad++, vscode, sublime text, geany, etc.)
    2. Install python from python’s website or some package manager for your platform.
    3. Create folder named python-tutorial.
    4. Into that folder create file named hello.py.
    5. Open file hello.py in in favourate text editor.
    6. Type print(“Hello World!”).
    7. Change directory to python-tutorial in terminal or command line.
    8. Type python3 hello.py in terminal or command line.
    9. It should show text Hello World!.
Variables

Variables are the special type of containers that store some kind of a value, example:

integer_var = 5
character_var = ‘a’
boolean_var_one = True
boolean_var_two = False
string_var = “Hello World!!”
formated_string_var = f“Number: {integer_var}”


As you can there are multiple types of variable that can be declared and used, types are (integer, boolean, character, string, formated string).

You can use variables in your code like this:

print(“String: ”, string_var)
print(“Integer: “, integer_var)
print(“Character: “, character_var)
print(“Boolean True: “, boolean_var_one)
print(“Boolean False: “, boolean_var_two)
print(“Formated string: ”, formated_string_var)


You can re-declare the variables like this:

integer_var = 20
character_var = ‘b’
boolean_var_two = True
boolean_var_one = False
string_var = “Shivansh!”
formated_string_var = “Hello {string_var}”


You can new variable by using existing variable like this:

my_age = integer_var
my_name = string_var
world_sucks = boolean_var_two


Project 1

    • Create file variables.py in your project folder.
    • Create variables like this (replace variable values as you want):
      
      integer_var = 20
      string_var_one = “Shivansh”
      string_var_two = “Shrivastava”


    • Declare more variables with names of existing variables:
      
      my_age = integer_var
      my_name = string_var_one
      my_surname = string_var_two
      my_full_name = f”{my_name} {my_surname}”


    • Use print function to show them in the terminal or command line:
      
      print(“My age: “, my_age)
      print(“My name: “, my_name)
